* [Material UI](https://material-ui.com) - React Components that Implement Google's Material Design.
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
* [Reach Router](https://reach.tech) - Router manages the focus of your app on route transitions.
* [Reach Helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet) - Manage all of your changes to the document head.
* [ESLint](https://eslint.org) - A pluggable and configurable linter tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript.
